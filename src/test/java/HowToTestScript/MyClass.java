            // myMethod2(); <-- This won't work, we can't directly access a none static method from a static method like main and that's why we create objects,like below.

            MyClass a = new MyClass();

            a.y = 12;
            a.x = 13;

            a.myMethod2(); //   Now this works

            MyClass.x = 55;

            System.out.println("Value of y in object a is : " + a.y);
            System.out.println("Value of x in object a is : " + a.x);
